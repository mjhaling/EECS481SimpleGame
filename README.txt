My game is a simple game where you click the first button and it disappears.
After this, a button will randomly appear on the screen and ask you to press it.
This will happen ten times. You two points for hitting the button, and
-1 points for not hitting the button. After the button appears 10 times
the game reports your score and offers you to start over.

My project is zipped in an archive. To run it, open the archive and then open the
project in eclipse and run it on an emulator or Android device.
